### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on Digital Twin for Digital Substation Communication Networks
- :satellite:	I'm part of [@midiacom](https://github.com/midiacom) and [@FriendsLabUFF](https://github.com/FriendsLabUFF)
- ðŸŒ± My interests are:
  - Python (mainly communications, sockets and protocols) and Linux;
  - Smart Grid (IEC 61850), MMS, GOOSE and SV;
  - Digital Twin, Digital Substations and SDN (Software-Defined Network);
  - I also research 5G sometimes.
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with Python speedup (probably with Rust)
- ðŸ’¬ I can help you with: Python and IEC 61850
